<p align="center">I am IIT kharagpur graduate. I'm passionate about computer systems, problem solving and algorithms. Throughout my life, I have been driven by curiosity to learn new things. I am always up for a challenge and exploring new technologies. 

</p>

<p align="center">
I have a particular interest in developing high-performance systems which require in-depth knowledge of computer systems and networks. I have worked on developing throttling systems for C++ based concurrent server, leveraging shared memory, semaphores and sockets. I have also worked in big data technologies like Apache Flink, HBase, etc. with some brief exposure to working in front-end technologies like Nodejs and Angular. Currently, I am working on the development of low latency trading system in C++.
